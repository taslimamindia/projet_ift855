# Project IFT855 | Universit√© de Sherbrooke

This project, carried out as part of a research essay at the University of Sherbrooke, aims to implement a complete MLOps approach. Its objective is to develop and deploy an artificial intelligence system capable of answering user questions by leveraging web crawling techniques to automatically extract and process relevant information.

The project covers the full solution lifecycle, including:

Data acquisition and preprocessing through web crawling.

Implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.

Automation of the MLOps pipeline for continuous integration and deployment.

Deployment of an API enabling users to interact with the system.

This repository contains the code, documentation, and configuration required to reproduce and further develop the project.
